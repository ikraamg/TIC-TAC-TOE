# TIC-TAC-TOE

> This game is a virtual implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game.

This game is played on a 3 x 3 grid between two players. The aim is for one of the two players to have 3 of their characters("X" or "O") in a row or diagonally. The first player to do so, wins the game!

_In this step we created two folders, bin and lib. The game executable file was created, main.rb and is contaiend in the bin folder._
