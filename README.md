# TIC-TAC-TOE

> This game is a virtual implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game.

## RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

5. In this virtual implementation, you and your friend can place a mark by selecting from the numbers 1 to 9 when prompted. This is illustrated below:


| (1) | (2) | (3) |
-------------------
| (4) | (5) | (6) |
-------------------
| (7) | (8) | (9) |
-------------------

6. A winning position would like the image below at the end. As soon as someone gets three of their marks in a row, the game ends.


|  O  |  X  |  O  | 
-------------------
|  X  |  X  |  X  |  --- *Player 'X' wins with this row!*
-------------------
|  O  |  O  |  O  |
-------------------
