# TIC-TAC-TOE

> This game is a virtual implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game.

- This game is played on a 3 x 3 grid between two players.
- Each player will take turn in placing their letter which is an "X" or "O" onto the grid boar. Placed by selecting the numbers 1 to 9 when prompted.


| (1) | (2) | (3) |
-------------------
| (4) | (5) | (6) |
-------------------
| (7) | (8) | (9) |
-------------------

- The aim is for one of the two players to have 3 of their characters("X" or "O") in a row or diagonally. The first player to do so, wins the game!


|  O  |  X  |  O  | 
-------------------
|  X  |  X  |  X  |  --- *Player 'X' wins with this row!*
-------------------
|  O  |  O  |  X  |
-------------------
